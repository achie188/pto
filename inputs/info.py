    Our F1 engineers have designed the fastest, lightest electric race karts in the world.

    Available as a Bambino, Cadet and Junior, they’re exclusively to GKL® drivers. Since we build and operate the fleet, we can ensure equal performance across the grid.

    Developed in-house with F1 expertise and AWS, Talent ID® is a data-driven, objective data acquisition and analysis platform.

    Talent ID® is a uniquely granular database of driver metrics, meaning GKL® will have a global view on the most talented drivers and an opportunity to manage them as their careers progress.
    
    We’re not only looking for the next generation of F1 drivers, but also the technologists that will design, develop and build the future of motorsport.

    Developed in-house by Formula 1® engineers, our STEM platform uses the power of motorsport to engage drivers in science, engineering, technology and maths.

    Silverstone Circuit is a motor racing circuit in England, near the Northamptonshire villages of Towcester, Silverstone and Whittlebury. It is the home of the 
    British Grand Prix, which it first hosted as the 1948 British Grand Prix. The 1950 British Grand Prix at Silverstone was the first race in the newly created 
    World Championship of Drivers. The race rotated between Silverstone, Aintree and Brands Hatch from 1955 to 1986, but settled permanently at the Silverstone 
    track in 1987. The circuit also hosts the British round of the MotoGP series.
